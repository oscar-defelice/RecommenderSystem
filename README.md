# Recommender System
This repository contains some code to implement a recommender system.

## Introduction
Given the constant rise of dating related apps - such as Tinder, Lovoo, Hitch - the algorithms for recommending new users have got a lot more complex. In a market with such a low entry barrier, suggesting users that are more likely to yield matches is for sure an important competitive edge.

Not only dating apps could benefit of such a system. Indeed, nowadays the existence of places collecting different industries - like co-working spaces, startup hubs, etc. - is becoming more and more frequent in our cities.

A user recommender system (where _the thing to be recommended_ is the user itself) can face the issues of both these systems.

## Installation instructions

To not mess up with versioning and package installation, we strongly advice to create a virtual environment.
One can follow [this guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) and the suitable section according to the OS.

Once the virtual environment has been set up, as usual, one has to run the following instruction from a command line

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs all the packages the code in this repository needs.
